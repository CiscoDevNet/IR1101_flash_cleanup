# IR1101_flash_cleanup

Routers ordered and shipped with autonomous mode and running 17.9.x v3 version and above until December 2024, might be affected by a reduced flash available space to perform software upgrade. These affected routers contain both .bin and .pkg files loaded into the flash.

This folder has EEM / Python scripts which deletes .bin and .pkg files from the flash.
