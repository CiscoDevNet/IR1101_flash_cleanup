# IR1101_flash_cleanup

Routers ordered and shipped with autonomous mode and running 17.9.x version and above until December 2024, might be affected by a reduced flash available space to perform software upgrade. These affected routers contain both .bin and .pkg files loaded into the flash.

This folder contains EEM and Python scripts that delete .bin and .pkg files from the flash.

Folder Structure:

1) Refer to the “Autonomous_Deployments” folder for Autonomous deployments.
3) Refer to the “FND_deployments” folder for FND deployments.
5) Refer to the “SD_Routing_deployments” folder for SD Routing deployments.
